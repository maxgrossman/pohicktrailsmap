<p>Pohick Trails Map was created as a final project for the GW Geography Department's senior seminar class. 
The trails map team went to Pohick Bay Regional Park and collected gpx tracks and waypoints at important locations along the park's trails using <a href="www.oruxmaps.com" >mobile data collection apps</a> made for <a href="www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap</a>. The team then collaborated with park staff and park-goers to try to make useful maps with the information we found.</p>
