<p>Pohick Trail Map was created as a final project for the GW Geography Department's senior seminar class. 
The trails map team went to Pohick Bay Regional Park and collected gpx tracks and waypoints at important locations along the park's trails using <a href="www.oruxmaps.com" >mobile data collection apps</a> that utilize <a href="www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap</a>. The team then collaborated with park staff and park-goers to understand what info would be helpful if put on the map. The results are what you find in the maps section.</p>
