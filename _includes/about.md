Pohick Trails Map was created as a final project for the GW Geography Department's senior seminar class. 

The Trails Map team went to Pohick Bay Regional Park and collected gpx tracks and waypoints at important locations along the park's trails using [mobile apps](www.oruxmaps.com) made for [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org).

Then we mapped that. See the methods page for more!
